In this Current Version, we need to give some options(specifically schema to the graphql endpoint).
For this, we created a folder called schema which contains a file called schema.js.
Here we will specify how our graph will look like: 
1) The data types of the object nodes,
2) The relationship between those data types
3) How to query and return the data.
